# Download_Financial_Reports
This is a script to download 10-k's and 20-f's from the SEC/Edgar website. 
The site is indexable by a companies stock ticker and thats how the script works.
For example if you wanted to go to Apple's annual reports you would just insert their stock ticker(AAPL) into the url. 
EX. https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK={ Stock Ticker }&type=10-k&dateb=&owner=exclude&count=20
